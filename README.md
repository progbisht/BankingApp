# BankingApp (Developed in C++ and Later in Node,Express and Handlebars)
The banking application emulates the banking system and the services provided by the banks. Just like an online banking system which provides various functionalities
such as deposits, withdrawls, transfers, updating profiles, and deleting accounts. This is a minor application (console-based application) developed in C++ programming language
and Object Oriented Programming concepts to learn the implementation of programming concepts in real-world situations.
# Recent Version 
This application is later upgraded with Node and Express at the backend and handlebars (template engine) are used at the front end. The functionalities are similar to the console
based application but this one is built using proper authentication requiring an access token to access the data.

### C++ code is on master branch, Node JS code is on main branch.
